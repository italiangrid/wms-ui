To build the software you need cmake to be installed.
type

cmake . -DPREFIX=<your_preferred_path> -DOS=<sl5|sl6> [-DMOCKCFG=<mock_cfg_file>] [-DPVER=<software_version>] [-DAGE=<age_number>]

Square brackets express optional switches.

If you do not plan to do a mock build, then the <mock_cfg_file> can be anything 
(e.g. "none"). 
Otherwise you have to specify the name of an existing mock configuration 
file without extension and without path:

dorigoa@sl5-64 11:22:05 ~/wms-ui>ll /etc/mock/emi-3-sl5-x86_64.cfg 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2207 Mar 18 11:16 /etc/mock/emi-3-sl5-x86_64.cfg

dorigoa@sl5-64 11:22:11 ~/wms-ui>cmake . -DPREFIX=`pwd`/stage -DOS=sl5 -DMOCKCFG=emi-3-sl5-x86_64

Please note that for the moment OS can assume only the two values "sl5" and
"sl6" (no need to specify the architecture, because only 64bit is supported).
Debian build will come soon.

The very first cmake's output could be something like this:

------------------------------------------------------------

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

[sudo] password for dorigoa: 
dorigoa is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
-----------------------------------------

This is because build time dependencies are missing and cmake will install
them via yum for you. Of course it needs your password to execute the 'yum
install' command with root privileges. 
After installation a message like this will appear:

------------------------------
WARNING Please re-run cmake once again...
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
------------------------------

Deps have been installed, and cmake needs to be run once more to resolve them
and prepare the related macro variables.

If *ALL* deps are already installed, or after the second run with all deps
correctly installed, cmake will prepare the makefiles for the build.
Just type

make

This will build (and NOT stage) the artifacts. To stage the binaries just type

make install 

To build the (s)rpm packages just type:

make RPM

If you've specified the mock cfg file you can also do a mock build by typing:

make MOCK

the (s)rpm packages are save into $PWD/rpmbuild.

That's all, enjoy NOT using etics ;-)
